# 🍯 honeybot py

## 📮 About
HoneyBot is a python-based IRC bot. (**python3**)

Feel free to contribute to the project!

![alt text](honeybot_real.png "honeybot logo")

## 🕹 Project Motivation
Implementing the project in Java was weird, py's connect was sleek. Thus, the project stack was shifted over to Python.
If you can think of any features, plugins, or functionality you wish to see in the project. Feel free to add it yourself, or create an issue detailing your ideas. We highly recommend you attempt to implement it yourself first and ask for help in our discord server!

Psst. since i learnt py through this bot, we decided to keep a new-comers friendly policy. Feeling lost? Just ping.

## :thought_balloon: Project Testimonials
[@TannerFry](https://github.com/TannerFry)

> With experience in programming in Python, and implementing an SMTP email plugin for a different system, picking up HoneyBot and following the documentation provided for new-comers made it very simple to implement the same SMTP email plugin to the HoneyBot system. This was my first time contributing to an open-source
project on GitHub and it was an overall great experience. The welcoming of new contributors and documentation on how to contribute and implement plugins is great for people
who have never contributed to a project before, and Abdur-Rahmaan Janhangeer was extremely helpful when answering my questions and helping me along the way.

> HoneyBot is my first time collaborating to an open source project and I'm loving it. Before discovering HoneyBot, I was very intimidated on the idea of working with other people and had no idea what an IRC even was. Now I realize how much fun and rewarding it is to work together on a project with dedicated and friendly individuals. The documentation is easy to follow and everyone is super helpful. I highly recommend any new programmer who want to contribute on an open source project to try out HoneyBot. Personally I enjoy working on this project more than my own schoolwork.

> HoneyBot is my first open source project and I had never worked with an IRC before. For school I was required to contribute to projects, but it was always so intimidating to me. I had always heard it gets easier once you've gotten over the fear wall, and that's what HoneyBot did for me. Excellent readme and quick feedback allowed me to make my first plugin. Now I've made many contributions, and look forward to any new issues I can get my hands on. Abdur-Rahmaan Janhangeer has been extremely helpful and I owe him and this project a lot for getting me into the open source world.

## 🔧 Plugins Development

including it here. let's begin

a plugin has the following structure:

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
"""
[greet.py]
Greet Plugin
[Author]
Abdur-Rahmaan Janhangeer, pythonmembers.club
[About]
responds to .hi, demo of a basic plugin
[Commands]
>>> .hi
returns hoo
"""


class Plugin:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def run(self, incoming, methods, info):
        try:
            if info['command'] == 'PRIVMSG' and info['args'][1] == '.hi':
                methods['send'](info['address'], 'hooo')
        except Exception as e:
            print('woops plugin error ', e)
```
we see three parameters being passed to the run method ```, incoming, methods, info)```

#### parameter1: incoming

```incoming``` is the raw line and is not used except if you are not satisfied with the already provided methods

#### parameter2: methods

```methods``` is a dictionary of methods to ease your life. a quick look at [main.py](honeybot/main.py) reveals

```python
def methods(self):
        return {
                'send_raw': self.send,
                'send': self.send_target,
                'join': self.join
                }
```
where ```send_raw``` allows you to send in any string you want, thereby allowing you to implement any irc protocol from scratch

but, for most uses, ```send``` allows you to send a message to an address ```methods['send']('<address>', '<message>')```. using it in conjunction with info parameter allows you to send messages where it came from, in pm to the bot or in a channel. you can however hardcode the address.

```join``` allows you to join a channel by ```methods['join']('<channel name>')```

#### parameter3: info

for a normal run, info produces
```python
{
'prefix': 'appinv!c5e342c5@gateway/web/cgi-irc/kiwiirc.com/ip.200.200.22.200',
'command': 'PRIVMSG',
'address': '##bottestingmu',
'args': ['##bottestingmu', 'ef']
}
```
hence if you want messages, ```messages = info['args'][1:]``` or the first word if you want to check for command will be ```info['args'][1]```

#### wrapping up

hence
```python
if info['command'] == 'PRIVMSG' and info['args'][1] == '.hi':
    methods['send'](info['address'], 'hooo')
```
from above means
```
if message received == .hi:
    send(address, message)
```

## 📃 Contributing Guide

- don't forget to add your country flag here after accepted PR. i'll have to hunt it down on your profile if not.
- make sure to follow PEP8

**about PR**

different changes to different files. for example, someone making a weather plugin first he creates a new branch
```
git checkout -b "weather-plugin"
```
then he commits
```
git add *
git commit -m "added weather plugin"
```
then he push to create a PR with the branch
```
git push origin head
```
now let us say he wants to work on another issue, adding a joke in the jokes plugin, he creates another branch
```
git checkout -b "add-jokes"
```
after, same as before
```
git add *
git commit -m "added some jokes"
git push origin head
```
now he wants to fix his weather plugin, he changes branch
```
git checkout weather-plugin
```
works, then commit
```
git add *
git commit -m "fixed <issue>"
```
then a PR
```
git push origin head
```
**Why all these?**

So as not to reject a whole PR just because of some oddities. Reject only unneeded part.

## 🥄 Updating fork

Now, other changes are ongoing, what if you need the latest changes?

```
git pull origin master
```
helps if you cloned your own repo. What is you want to update your local copy of someone else repo?
you do it like that

```
cd <your/local/cloned/repo/path/here>
git remote add upstream git://github.com/Abdur-rahmaanJ/honeybot.git
git fetch upstream
git pull upstream master
```
