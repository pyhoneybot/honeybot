[About]
In the original russian roulette, you have a one sixth chance of committing
suicide. In this version, you have a one sixth chance of being kicked from
the channel. The bot will utilise the IRC command:
KICK #channel nickname
where #channel is the channel name and nicknames is the nickname of the user

WARNING: BOT MUST BE CHANNEL OPERATOR!!!

[Commands]
>>> .russian_roulette
either returns a string saying you survived or kicks you off the channel
